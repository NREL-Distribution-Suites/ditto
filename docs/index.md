# Distribution Transformation Tool (DiTTo)

DiTTo is a Distribution Transformation Tool that aims at providing an open source framework to convert various distribution systems modeling formats. DiTTo implements a many-to-one-to-many parsing framework which makes it modular and robust. Readers and writers are then implemented to perform the translation from a given format to the core representation, or the other way around.
